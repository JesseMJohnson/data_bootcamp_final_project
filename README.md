# Project Description

This project was a mapping exercise in which I mapped the "connectivity" of people across different Local Government Areas (LGAs) in Nigeria. in the project I created a score out of respondents' answers to various survey questions ranging from their possession of a cell phone to their usage of a cell phone for mobile banking. A higher score indicates more of these questions being answered positively, and therefore denoting a higher connectivity to the internet.
